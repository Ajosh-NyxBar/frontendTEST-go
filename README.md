# Task Tracker App Frontend

This is the Frontend implementation example of Task Tracker for Frontend Review.

Build this together with the students. Method of implementation is up to instructors:

- Instructors can do first part of the code, then the student will do, give a delay for student to type. In this implementation, instructor need to split the coding into logical parts that can be broken off easily, as in the logical part can be typed and a result can be checked to see that this part works as expected.

- Instructors can demo all in one go, then students will be given time at the end to work on their own.
